          <p>
            The first of our most famous performances is none other than the remarkable juggling bar.<br />
            Indeed, in this extraordinary performance is realized by our dear friend, Patrik the juggling bar.<br />
            She exerts numerous and dangerous series of juggling with men of all ages!<br />
            Wonderful figures are on the program in this magnificent choreography.<br /><br /> 
            You will not be disappointed!<br />

      <h2 id="bertha">Bertha,<br /> The Wheel Machine Washed !</h2>
          <p>
            For our next performance, I will introduce our dear and beloved Bertha! Our Wheel Machine Washed, very few know it because it is a little news in our circus.<br />
            Its goal ? Turn as much as possible and in all directions without ever falling down a single man!<br />
            And tonight! Bertha will perform an even more difficult and dangerous performance, it will turn entirely on fire and more than 5 meters from the ground! This will allow him to trounter in more sense than his habit!<br /><br />
            I warn you this high-risk show will leave you speechless!<br />
            I'll give it to you!

        <h2>Roxy, the lion trainer!</h2>
        <p>
        And finally for our last performance I present: Roxy our lion human trainer.<br />
        Its purpose is to make the man in the room play acrobatic tricks while doing it himself! It's simply amazing!<br />
        All in a cage lock but still out in the open air to ensure the safety of our visitor (we never know what the man could do if he came to escape!)<br />
        Roxy will give a dedication senate at the end of the show for the modest sum of £ 50.<br /><br />
        Come many you will love it!<br/>
        I'll give it to you!
